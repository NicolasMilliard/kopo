# Choices of technologies

## Next.js

The choice of the technology for the Dapp was ported to Next.js:

- it offers a fully compatible React environment.
- powerfull server backend.

Strong support and frequent updates.

## Ethers

- We were taught Web3.js at Alyra. We wanted to show we could also adapt to other frameworks.
- The smart contracts were deployed with Hardhat which uses Ethers to interact with blockchains.
- Ethers is quite a powerful and proven library.

## Wagmi

Wagmi is used in this project to support the initial connection with the wallet and the Dapp.
It already supports various chains and wallets which saved us time.

# Rainbowkit

RainbowKit handles the choice of the Wallet, it supports many different wallets:

- MetaMask
- WalletConnect
- LedgerLive
- Coinbase Wallet
- Argent

As we want the project to be used by the most people possible, it was important to support as many wallets and types of connection as possible.
